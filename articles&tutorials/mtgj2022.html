      <h2>Articles & Tutorials - Shitting Simulator a stupid game for minetest gamejam 2022 made in one day</h2>
        <li> So my friend Looki2000 asked me 3 days ago if I wanted to help him and his brother make a stupid game "Pooping Simulator" then I was reminded that minetest gamejam starts tomorrow, so why don't we create this game as a mintetest game and upload it to gamejam. We changed the name to "Shitting Simulator" just to make it funnier, because the rules of jam said that profanity is allowed. We all wanted to see a funny reaction from the minetest community. We tried to make the game as silly as possible, so we added basic mechanics: shitting and packing your poops into boxes for collecting the score. We've also added Robocops chasing you to make the game a bit harder. The process of creating this game was really fun and we all enjoyed it. </li>
